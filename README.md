# Heliverse-AI-internship-Assessment-Predicting-Employee-Attrition

- Predicting employee attrition is a multifaceted endeavor involving the comprehensive collection of historical employee data, including demographics, job roles, performance metrics, tenure, and satisfaction surveys. Following data collection, the process entails meticulous preprocessing and exploratory analysis to identify pertinent features and glean insights.

- Subsequently, various machine learning models, such as logistic regression, decision trees, or neural networks, are trained and evaluated using established metrics like accuracy and F1-score. This rigorous evaluation ensures the selection of an optimal model for deployment.

- Once validated, the chosen model is deployed to enable real-time predictions, facilitating the implementation of proactive retention strategies and fostering organizational stability. Ongoing monitoring and updates are integral to sustaining the model's efficacy, ensuring its continued effectiveness in addressing dynamic workforce challenges.

## Methodology

Here, I am going to use 5 simple steps to analyze Employee Attrition using Python software

- DATA COLLECTION
- DATA PRE PROCESSING
- DIVIDING THE DATA into TWO PARTS “TRAINING” AND “TESTING”
- BUILD UP THE MODEL USING “TRAINING DATA SET”
- DO THE ACCURACY TEST USING “TESTING DATA SET”

## Setup Instructions
1.Clone the repository: 

    git clone https://github.com/Ayushverma135/Heliverse-AI-internship-Assessment-Predicting-Employee-Attrition/
    
2.Install the required dependencies.

3.Navigate to the notebooks directory and run the Jupyter notebooks.

4.Once the model is trained and evaluated, deploy it using the provided scripts or integrate it into the production environment as needed.
